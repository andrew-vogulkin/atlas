# Serve Qwen3.8-Flash-Next (model_type qwen4_exp) — port tracked in Avarok #753.
#
# This serves: mHC highway on all 48 layers, PLE at model layer 1, QSA decode
# and prefill selection, vision, CUDA graphs, prefix caching, C>1.
#
# PLE SCRATCH IS SIZED FROM THE SERVE CONFIG, NOT AN ENV VAR. The engine
# derives its floor from --max-num-batched-tokens (floor 2048), so a
# 2191-token prompt no longer fails layer 1 by default. ATLAS_PLE_MAX_TOKENS
# is now only an override to trade PLE headroom for KV memory; setting it
# below the derived floor logs a warning and risks refused prefills. This
# script still sets it explicitly (9500 above 8192) as a harmless override.
#
# PRIMARY CHECKPOINT is the Inferact NVFP4 release. Against RadixArk's it has
# the same architecture and the same per-expert ModelOpt NVFP4 layout, but
# keeps the PLE n-gram tables in BF16 rather than FP8 — simpler to load (no
# dequant) and more accurate (on LongCat, BF16 n-gram rows measured 0.0050
# error against the reference vs FP8's 0.0247). It costs 170 GB on disk
# against 126 GB, but its RESIDENT footprint is smaller (74.9 vs 78.2 GB)
# because its MTP experts are quantized.
#
#   ./serve_qwen4exp_tui.sh                       # Inferact, port 8889
#   QWEN4EXP_PATH=/path/to/radixark ./serve_qwen4exp_tui.sh
#
# ONE Atlas instance at a time: --gpu-memory-utilization RESERVES its whole
# fraction up front, so a second server fails its OOM pre-flight.

# BF16 KV, matching the vendored recipe
# (`tests/fixtures/recipes/qwen3.8-flash-next/qwen3.8-flash-next-nvfp4.yaml`,
# `kv_cache_dtype: bf16`). Left unset, the server picks FP8 and then warns
# that this checkpoint ships NO k_scale/v_scale, so the scales default to 1.0
# and silently clip BF16 into E4M3's [-448, 448] — which costs coherence on an
# NVFP4 model exactly where it is hardest to notice, at long context. The
# recipe already said bf16; this script simply was not passing it.

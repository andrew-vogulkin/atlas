//! One call site per mHC entry point, for both variants.
//!
//! Atlas now runs two different hyper-connection families over the same
//! `[T, hc_mult, H]` FP32 highway:
//!
//! * DeepSeek-V4's — a Sinkhorn-normalized mix over `hc_fn`/`hc_scale`/
//!   `hc_base`, emitting a `[hc, hc]` combine matrix that `hc_post` mixes the
//!   saved streams through.
//! * Qwen3.8-Flash-Next's — a low-rank pair (rank 320) with a grouped
//!   RMSNorm, emitting one scalar per stream that `hc_post` scales by.
//!
//! They share the four kernel NAMES (a model shadow overrides the whole
//! `hyper_connection.cu` file) but take different argument lists. Rather than
//! branch at each of the 23 call sites across `prefill_inner`, `decode_inner`
//! and `multi_seq`, the branch lives here once, behind a signature that is
//! the union of both.
//!
//! **`post_out` doubles as the low-rank injection vector.** Both are `[T, hc]`
//! f32 and both are consumed by the matching `hc_post`, so the existing
//! `ctx.buffers.hc_post()` serves each variant without a second allocation.
//! `comb_out` is untouched on the low-rank path — Qwen scales each stream by
//! one scalar where DeepSeek mixes them through a full matrix.
//!
//! Selection is by WEIGHTS (`lowrank.is_some()`), never by model name. A site
//! carrying both would be a load-time bug rather than a silent coin-flip.

//! NVMe-backed row cache for the n-gram embedding tables.
//!
//! The n-gram tables of the LongCat / Qwen3.8-Flash-Next family are the
//! model's largest tensors by far (31.4 B params on LongCat-Flash-Lite,
//! ~51 B announced for Flash-Next) and simultaneously its *least*
//! bandwidth-hungry: a token touches exactly one row per table — 12 rows,
//! ~3 KB — regardless of sequence length. Pure capacity, near-zero
//! bandwidth, which makes them the best demotion candidate in the model.
//!
//! Design, and why it needs no CUDA kernel change:
//!
//! * The cache is a flat PINNED arena of `slots × row_stride` bytes. On
//!   GB10 pinned host memory is GPU-addressable at the SAME virtual address
//!   ([`ExpertArena`] asserts this), so the arena *is* a
//!   `[slots, dim]` device-side table.
//! * The n-gram row ids are computed HOST-side (they are a pure function of
//!   token ids), so a lookup resolves `row_id -> slot` on the host and hands
//!   the gather kernel the SLOT INDEX in place of the row id. `batched_embed`
//!   / `batched_embed_fp8` then run verbatim against the arena base.
//! * A miss reads the row straight off NVMe into its pinned slot — no
//!   `cuMemcpyHtoD` anywhere on the path.
//!
//! Eviction is CLOCK (second-chance): O(1), no per-hit bookkeeping, and it
//! approximates LRU well for the power-law access pattern these tables have.
//! Rows touched by the CURRENT batch are pinned so a large prefill can never
//! evict a row it is still about to read.
//!
//! O_DIRECT requires 4 KiB-aligned reads, while a row is typically 256 B
//! (FP8, dim 256). Reads are therefore issued as the containing 4 KiB block
//! into a bounce buffer and the row copied out — the block is the disk's
//! minimum transfer anyway, so this costs no extra I/O, only a 256 B host
//! memcpy. Cache capacity stays row-granular, which matters because the
//! hash scatters ids: neighbouring rows in a table are unrelated.
